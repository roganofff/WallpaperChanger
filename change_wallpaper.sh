# Check if there is a file that contains a hashed password:
#   If not, create it and set up a password.
# If such a file exists:
#   Read from keyboard a password:
#       If passwords match:
#           Change the desktop wallpapers to random cat pic
#       If they do not match:
#           Lookup for web-camera:
#               If there is a web-cam take a picture of thief's face and set up it as a wallpaper.
#               If no web-cam was found, do nothing
